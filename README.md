Brief Introduction to our project:
We are trying to build a fun game which can engage the user and at the same time can help the user stay fit in these difficult times.
The basic idea of the game is that the user has to do some movements and then he'll be winning some rewards for that.The game will progress in this manner.
Tracking the user's movements and building an animated model with which the user can interact are two sub-parts of the project.

Libraries and dependancies:
The online editor that we are using:https://editor.p5js.org/#
The library we are using for detecting the position of the user:https://ml5js.org/reference/api-PoseNet/

The code that we have done so far has been added to the repo.The files can be opened in p5 editor mentioned above.
The individual files have been uploaded.The main code file is sketch.js and you can open it in the p5 editor.Rest of the files are dependancies.

Warning:Dont open it by Node use browser
